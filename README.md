# Design Pattern

Detail design pattern and give many demos of Java.

## Singleton Pattern

　　In software engineering, the singleton pattern is a software design pattern that restricts the instantiation of a class to one object. This is useful when exactly one object is needed to coordinate actions across the system. The concept is sometimes generalized to systems that operate more efficiently when only one object exists, or that restrict the instantiation to a certain number of objects. The term comes from the mathematical concept of a singleton.

> How to implement a  Singleton Pattern?

An implementation of the singleton pattern must:

- ensure that only one instance of the singleton class ever exists; and
- provide global access to that instance.

Typically, this is done by:

- declaring all constructors of the class to be private; and
- providing a static method that returns a reference to the instance.

The instance is usually stored as a private static variable; the instance is created when the variable is initialized, at some point before the static method is first called.
